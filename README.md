# Chess
This is a player vs player, command line chess game, made with Ruby. It is part of [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. It is a fully functional chess game with every standard rule included that doesn't involve a timer.

## Useage
- You can fork this repo and play it locally by running bundle install and then ruby lib/main.rb
- You can also play on the [replit](https://replit.com/@cwalker3/Chess) although it doesn't look very good on there and runs slower.

## What I learned
 - Organization - This project was many times bigger than any previous project in the curriculum and involved a large amount of classes and modules so it was very important to keep everything organized.

 - Testing - I didn't test everything but it was very useful for making sure that pieces moved correctly and situations such as checkmate worked correctly.

## What I could change
 - The board and game classes are quite long and could be make shorter.
 - There is currently no validation for FEN strings.
## Features Could be Added
 - Chess AI - I would like to implement a Stockfish AI in the future.
