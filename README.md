# Chess
This is a player vs player, command line chess game, made with ruby. It is part of [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum.

## Demo

## What I learned
 - Organization - This project was many times bigger than any previous project in the curriculum so it was very important to keep the classes organized.

 - Testing - I didn't test everything but it was very useful for making sure that pieces moved correctly and situations such as checkmate worked correctly.

## What I could do better
