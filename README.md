# Chess
This is a player vs player, command line chess game, made with Ruby. It is part of [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. It is a fully functional chess game with every standard rule included that doesn't involve a timer. 

## Demo

## What I learned
 - Organization - This project was many times bigger than any previous project in the curriculum and involved a large amount of classes and modules so it was very important to keep everything organized.

 - Testing - I didn't test everything but it was very useful for making sure that pieces moved correctly and situations such as checkmate worked correctly.

## What I could change
 - The board and game classes are quite long and could be make shorter.
 - Naming - I had some trouble with naming which could be confusing to people reading my code or my future self.
## Features Could be Added
 - Chess AI - I would like to somehow implement a Stockfish AI in the future.
